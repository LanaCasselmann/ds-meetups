    "Recommender systems are algorithms which suggest information of interest to the user. If you ever used the internet, you will surely have made contact with a recommender system. Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, all make use of such functions to improve user satisfaction as well as buying behavior. Based on your previous activityThe recommender system will suggest you the next video, product, song or whatever. The most common recommender types are content based, collaborative filtering and hybrid models of those two types.\n",

A content based model has the advantage that no user data is required and the model can be scaled to a large number of users independently of their preferences. Solving the cold start problem.
