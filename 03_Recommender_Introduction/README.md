# Neuefische Meetups

![](images/beautiful_soup.jpeg)

This repository contains the material for our meetup workshop **"Introduction to recommender systems"**

This 2h workshop is aimed at people who have already gathered first experiences in Python programming and want to get insights on how recommender systems are build. We will give a short introduction to the basics of recommender systems and continue with an example of how to build your own content based and collaborative filtering recommender systems.

## Materials

We have added our [Introduction to recommender systems presentation]() if you would like to revisit it.

For both topics we have also created notebooks, that are stored in this repository.
With the links below, you can quite easily run them online in google colab.

## Requirements

If you want to run these notebooks locally, make sure you're using **Python 3**.

The required Python libraries that are needed are listed in the [requirements.txt file](requirements.txt).

## Recording

We recorded the event and you can find the video on our [neuefische youtube channel]().
